# Access-Point-Simulator-and-Analysis-Program
This program will contain the different version of an access point simulation program. 

## Version 1
This first version would only contain the mechanics of opening a building blueprint and adding access point objects. 

### How will I add the building blueprint?
There will be a function that'll add an image for a building blueprint. This image viewing mechanics would need the blueprint to be shown in full. As such, there should also be a highly customizable zoom and moving function.

### How will I add the access points?
There must be a button on the gui which is labeled as add_accessPoint. Once clicking this button, the user should be able to click anywhere on the blueprint and a node is added.
